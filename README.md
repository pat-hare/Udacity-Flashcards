Udacity Flashcards App Project - Final Project

This was bootstrapped with create-react-native-app. It was tested and runs in the expo emulator. All the stylings and code has been tested for android and not iOS and has all been run through an emulator, not a physical device.

To start the app:
 - Git clone the app from the provided link on github
 - cd into the udacity-flashcards folder and run yarn start
 - Once the dependencies have been downloaded start up the expo emulator if using the emulator (it has been designed for a Samsung S8)
 - Once the VM is running start the app by running yarn start
 - A menu of options will appear in the temrinal - press 'a' if using the emulator and the app will start in the VM (scan the QR code to use your phone)


To run a quiz:
 - Press the quiz you want to run
 - You'll be presented with the options to start the quiz or add a card => press start the quiz
 - A question will appear, here you can attempt the answer before clicking show answer
 - If you were correct, press correct, vice versa for incorrect
 - Once the final question has been answered a score will show with your answers
 - You can now choose to start over or try another quiz

To add a card:
 - Press the quiz you want to add a card to
 - You'll be presented with the options to start the quiz or add a card => press add a card
 - Enter the question and answer
 - Your card has been added - start the quiz to see it in the deck

To add a quiz:
 - Press the add deck tab
 - Enter the deck title and press submit
 - Your deck is now visible on the list
 - To add questions, see 'to add a card'; to run the quiz, see 'to run a quiz'

Thank you for your review and time. The course has been an incredible experience.

During the project I gathered ideas from other github repos but as per the Udacity Honor Code guidelines I closed their work and did not look at the code whilst writing mine, I gathered concepts and ideas they used such as the use of state in switching quiz questions and adding redux dispatch properties to AddCard and AddDeck.
